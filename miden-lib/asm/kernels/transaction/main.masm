#! This is the entrypoint for the transaction kernel program. It is composed of the following
#! program sections:
#!
#! 1. Prologue: execute the transaction prologue which prepares the transaction for processing
#!    by parsing the transaction data and setting up the root context.
#! 2. Note Processing: execute the note processing loop which consumes each input note and
#!    invokes the note script of each note via a `dyncall` instruction invocation.
#! 3. Transaction Script Processing: execute the transaction script if it exists via the invocation
#!    of a `dyncall` instruction.
#! 4. Epilogue: execute the transaction epilogue which finalizes the transaction by computing the
#!    created notes commitment, the final account hash, asserting asset invariant conditions and
#!    asserting the nonce rules are upheld.
#!
#! Stack:        [BH, acct_id, IAH, NC]
#! Advice stack: [NR, PH, CR, SR, BR, PH, BN,
#!                acct_id, ZERO, ZERO, nonce, AVR, ASR, ACR,
#!                num_cn,
#!                CN1_SN, CN1_SR, CN1_IR, CN1_VR, CN1_M, CN1_NA
#!                CN1_A1, CN1_A2, ...
#!                CN2_SN,CN2_SR, CN2_IR, CN2_VR, CN2_M, CN2_NA
#!                CN2_A1, CN2_A2, ...,
#!                ...,
#!                TXSR]
#! Output:       [TXSR, CNC, FAH]
#!
#!
#! - BH is the latest known block hash at the time of transaction execution.
#! - acct_id is the account id of the account that the transaction is being executed against.
#! - NR is the note root of the last known block.
#! - PH is the previous hash of the last known block.
#! - CR is the chain root of the last known block.
#! - SR is the state root of the last known block.
#! - BR is the batch root of the last known block.
#! - PH is the proof hash of the last known block.
#! - BN is the block number of the last known block ([block_number, 0, 0, 0]).
#! - IAH is the initial account hash of the account that the transaction is being executed against.
#! - NC is the nullifier commitment of the transaction. This is a sequential hash of all
#!   (nullifier, script_root) pairs for the notes consumed in the transaction.
#! - nonce is the account nonce.
#! - AVR is the account vault root.
#! - ASR is the account storage root.
#! - ACR is the account code root.
#! - num_cn is the number of consumed notes.
#! - CN1_SN is the serial number of consumed note 1.
#! - CN1_SR is the script root of consumed note 1.
#! - CN1_IR is the inputs root of consumed note 1.
#! - CN1_VR is the vault root of consumed note 1.
#! - CN1_M is the metadata of consumed note 1.
#! - CN1_NA are optional note args of consumed note 1.
#! - CN1_A1 is the first asset of consumed note 1.
#! - CN1_A2 is the second asset of consumed note 1.
#! - TXSR is the transaction script root.
#! - CNC is the commitment to the notes created by the transaction.
#! - FAH is the final account hash of the account that the transaction is being
#!   executed against.
