# ERRORS
# =================================================================================================

# SWAP script expects exactly 9 note inputs
const.ERR_SWAP_WRONG_NUMBER_OF_INPUTS=0x00020007

# SWAP script requires exactly one note asset
const.ERR_SWAP_WRONG_NUMBER_OF_ASSETS=0x00020008

# Swap script: adds an asset from the note into consumers account and
# creates a note consumable by note issuer containing requested ASSET.
#
# Requires that the account exposes:
#
# Inputs: [SCRIPT_ROOT]
# Outputs: []
#
# Note inputs are assumed to be as follows:
# - RECIPIENT
# - ASSET
# - TAG = [tag, 0, 0, 0]
#
# FAILS if:
# - Account does not expose miden::contracts::wallets::basic::receive_asset procedure
# - Account does not expose miden::contracts::wallets::basic::send_asset procedure
# - Account vault does not contain the requested asset
# - Adding a fungible asset would result in amount overflow, i.e., the total amount would be
#   greater than 2^63
